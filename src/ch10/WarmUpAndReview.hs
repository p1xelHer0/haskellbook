module WarmUpAndReview where

-- 1. Given the following sets of consonants and vowels:

stops = "pbtdkg"
vowels = "aeiou"

-- a) Write a function that takes inputs from stops and vowels and
--    makes 3-tuples of all possible stop-vowel-stop combinations.
--    These will not all correspond to real words in English,
--    although the stop-vowel-stop pattern is common enough that many of them will.


-- b) Modify that function so that it only returns the com- binations that begin with a p.


-- c) Now set up lists of nouns and verbs (instead of stops and vowels) and
--    modify the function to make tuples representing possible noun-verb-noun sentences.
